Goal: To show how growing more food in South Africa can lower the need for imports, create jobs, and make the best use of land based on the weather in each area.

1. The Economic Impact: Jobs & Imports

Decreasing the "import gap" is a direct lever for economic growth.

-Job Multiplication: For every 1% increase in agricultural GDP, there is a measurable reduction in the national unemployment rate. Agriculture is labor-intensive, meaning more hands are needed for harvesting, processing, and packaging.
-The Value Chain: It's not just about the farmer. High local demand creates "upstream" jobs (seed supply, fertilizers, tools) and "downstream" jobs (agro-processing, logistics, and retail).
-Trade Balance: South Africa spent approximately R133 billion ($7bn) on agricultural imports in 2023. Diverting even a fraction of this to local producers keeps wealth within South African borders.
